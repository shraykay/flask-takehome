# DevOps Home Exercise

* Given a  webapp (attached as a zip) that needs to connect to a DB, create a docker-compose or other orchestration file that will allow the webapp to talk to these services in a portable environment. If you choose not to use an orchestration file, explain how you would otherwise connect them in a portable way, why this is a superior approach, and how you would scale it.

*  Deliverable: a zip or otherwise compressed file. This file MUST include take_home.py and it MUST include a README.MD that will explain how to run this app so it works.
